Builder Design Pattern

It is a part of creational design pattern.

It is used when we want to create a complex object.

In this we are creating Builder inner class which has all fields which are present in the main class(i.e, User class)
and then we have one build() which passes the User object having Builder parameter in it.

If someone calls the build() then it will store all the values of User object and return the obj.
